## Detection of canopy gaps using the AHN
In the Netherlands, the emergence of canopy gaps in forests is currently hardly monitored. The AHN provides the oppertunity to detect the emergence of new canopy gaps, as it is a multitemporal LiDAR dataset. This project aimed to detect canopy gaps from two versions of the AHN, namely AHN3 and AHN4. Two methods were used to derive these canopy gaps: a method inspired by Vepakkoma et al. (2012)* and by Leitold et al. (2018)**. At last, statistical comparisons were made between the identified canopy gaps to investigate the influence of forest management on canopy gap dynamics.
